# Home Assistant Community Add-on: Portainer

Portainer is an open-source lightweight management UI which allows you to
easily manage a Docker host(s) or Docker swarm clusters.

It has never been so easy to manage Docker. Portainer provides a detailed
overview of Docker and allows you to manage containers, images, networks and
volumes.

## WARNING

The Portainer add-on is really powerful and gives you access to virtually
your whole system. While this add-on is created and maintained with care and
with security in mind, in the wrong or inexperienced hands,
it could damage your system.

## Installation

To install this add-on, you'll first need to go to your profile and turn on
"Advanced Mode", once that is done go back to Home Assistant add-ons and search
for "Portainer" and install it as you would any other add-on.

To be able to use this add-on, you'll need to disable protection mode on this
add-on. Without it, the add-on is unable to access Docker.

1. Search for the "Portainer" add-on in the Supervisor add-on store and
   install it.
1. Set the "Protection mode" switch to off.
1. Start the "Portainer" add-on.
1. Check the logs of the "Portainer" add-on to see if everything went well.

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
log_level: info
agent_secret: password
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`: Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `agent_secret`

An option to set a shared agent secret. Must also be set in the remote agent
as an Environment variable.

## Known issues and limitations

By default all Home Assistant managed containers are hidden from Portainer.
This is recommended since fooling around with Home Assistant managed containers
can easily lead to a broken system.

Access to these containers can be gained by going into Portainer ->
Settings -> Hidden containers. Then delete the listed hidden labels
(io.hass.type labels). **Only do this if you know what you're doing!**
