This is a pretty basic implementation of ioBroker as Home Assistant Add-on.
It is meant to provide some playground.

Mostly created as playfield for: https://blog.fuzzymistborn.com/controlling-eufy-security-devices-with-iobroker/  
and https://community.home-assistant.io/t/eufy-camera-integration/121758

See the Documentation (DOCS.md) for more info.

**This is no official add-on, neither from Home Assisant, nor from ioBroker.**
