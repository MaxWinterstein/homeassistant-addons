## Usage

1. Install the add-on from [this repository](https://github.com/MaxWinterstein/homeassistant-addons/).
2. You can start the add-on right away with the default configuration, but for best results, itâ€™s recommended to adjust the configuration (such as email, location, etc.) in the add-on options.
3. Start the add-on.
4. Visit the add-on web UI to see the live log and retrieve your sharing key.

**How to find your sharing key:**  
After running the add-on, look for a log line like this in the output:

> _Your sharing key (**abc123def456**) has been configured and emailed to you for backup purposes._

The value in parentheses is your Flightradar24 sharing key.
